 <p style="font-size: 22px"><i>I was born and raised in Cranberry Township,Pennsylvania. I am currently 18 years old, going to school at Seneca Valley. Additionally, I have been attending Butler County Vocational and Technical School, studying computer networking and security. During my time there, I have been able to achieve the Testout PC Pro certification, the Testout Network Pro Certification, and the Comptia A+, as well as becoming a member of the National Technical Honors Society.I've worked since I was 15, at a variety of Fast-food and retail jobs. Every job I've worked so far has had good parts and bad parts, but I believe the true value of them is that they have all helped me to build a strong work ethic, and respect for people working in the service industry every day.</i></p>
