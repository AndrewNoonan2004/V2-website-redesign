    <h2 style="font-size: 30px">Free Software in Schools</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px"> Many companies like to say that they provide their software for free. Is it really free, or is the cost much greater? An English dictionary has many different definitions for the word free, with only two referring to price. The rest refer to “liberty” or “not controlled by another”. As such, it is important to remove the ambiguity surrounding the world “free” within the English language. Unlike in a language like Spanish, the same word is used for free (provided at no monetary cost), and free as in freedom. Throughout this essay, free will be used to refer to freedom, and the Spanish word “gratis” will be used for something that is available without monetary cost. Additionally, the words “proprietary” and “non-free” may be used interchangeably. </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-size: 18px"> Furthermore, it is important to define what qualifies a program as free software. It is generally agreed upon that free software offers the users at least the following four freedoms. The first is the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any reason you see fit. The second is the freedom to study and change it. This requires access to the source code. The third is the freedom to distribute exact copies of the program, and the fourth is the freedom to redistribute modified versions, which is also requires access to the source code. Freedom two and freedom four require access to the source code because studying and modifying the software without a source code is quite difficult.("What is Free Software")</p>
  <br />
 <p style="font-size: 18px"> Some programs that schools could use that qualify as free software include LibreOffice or OnlyOffice as replacements for the Microsoft suite of productivity tools. The school could use Jitsi or Rocket.Chat instead of Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Additionally, instead of using Microsoft Windows, The school could use GNU/Linux, often referred to as just Linux. For the schools email, they could self-host. Lastly, instead of using Smart Notebook, they could use Openboard.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px">Free software programs are often referred to as “open source”. “open source”, however,  misses the point of free software. It ignores the ethical issues with proprietary software that free software seeks to fix, in favor of focusing on the practical advantages.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px"> As we progress into an increasing digital age, the ethical issues with proprietary software will only become more important. As such, schools should use exclusively free software. This is because free software encourages learning, proprietary software mistreats its users, and schools could save money using free software.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px">The Status quo is to not consider these ethical issues, and focus on convenience, or ease of use. Most schools use exclusively proprietary software, like Microsoft Windows, Chrome OS, and Zoom. Some schools may use the learning management software Moodle or Canvas, both of which are free software, but that is usually the extent of the free software that they use.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px"> 	Firstly, schools should use exclusively free software because it encourages learning. Schools often provide ‘Mission Statements’, where they outline in broad terms what they hope to achieve. One example is the mission statement for the Seneca Valley School District, which is, “In collaboration with family and community, the mission of the Seneca Valley School District is to provide a nurturing and safe environment with academically challenging opportunities, emphasizing digital citizenship, innovation, and global awareness in order to prepare our students to be productive and contributing citizens.” This clearly states that the school wants to encourage learning, in order to make productive and contributing citizens. Free software allows the school to promote their philosophical objectives in cyberspace. The school is able to distribute copies of the programs they use to students, and the students are able to study the program, make changes to the program, and share with others. They can enable kids who want to be programmers to gain more practical experience working in software development, by allowing them to practice making modifications to existing large programs, rather than only gaining experience making their own personal programs.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px"> In contrast, non-free software often comes with restrictive EULAs(End User License Agreements) that actually make it illegal to study the programs. One example of this is the Windows Operating system. In the “restrictions” section of the EULA, it says that you cannot attempt to “reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software, or attempt to do so…”As a result, using this program is antithetical to the mission of a school, and the spirit of education. In the words of Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project, “The knowledge you want is a secret—learning is forbidden!”</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px"> In addition, Schools should use exclusively free software because proprietary software mistreats its users. All proprietary programs mistreat the users through being proprietary. It gives the developers power over the users, and power corrupts. One of the most common additional ways in which proprietary programs mistreat the user is spying. This is especially an issue in schools, where you often don’t have a choice to use these programs or not. Additionally, many of these educational programs don’t provide privacy policies. According to a study by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, A nonprofit organization committed to defending civil liberties and digital rights, “Of the 152 ed tech services reported to us, only 118 had published privacy policies online. Some applications note that schools may implement their own privacy policies to govern personal data submitted to the services by student users.”(Alim, Cardozo, Gebhart). That means only about 78% of the programs commonly used in a school environment have any privacy policy at all. Additionally, the study mentions that, “Of the 118 privacy policies, 78 mention data retention practices. Few privacy policies address deletion of data after periods of inactivity, which would allow the applications to retain information even after students graduate.”(Alim, Cardozo, Gebhart) This means that only about half of the 152 programs mentioned in the study have any information about how long they store the data they collect on students. Perhaps even more egregious, only 30 percent of the services in the study have any mention of encryption at all, with it most often only being mentioned for financial information, with no mention of whether or not they encrypt the data they collect on students. All of this amounts to a lack of respect for students privacy, and mistreatment of the user.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px">Another way in which proprietary software mistreats the user is through the use of censorship. One example of this was when Amazon remotely deleted thousands of copies of books from Kindle devices. In a case of dramatic irony, the book that Amazon deleted was 1984, by George Orwell. According to a Guardian article about this issue, “The books - downloaded from Amazon.com by American Kindle users - were remotely deleted after what the US company now says was a rights issue regarding the publisher, MobileReference.com.”(Johnson).They have every right to remove the book from their own store, but they shouldn’t be able to remove the books from users devices. Imagine buying a counterfeit book from Barnes and Noble, and the cops came and forcefully removed the book. This essentially gives Amazon the power to become modern day book-burners, and one can see how this could lead to a real-life reincarnation of ‘Fahrenheit 451’, where non-free software allows the government to trivially censor and ban books. Amazon doesn’t stand alone in their willingness to censor. In recent years, many proprietary software developers  have been enforcers of censorship. During the most recent Russian election, Apple and Google were forced to remove the app made by the opposition leader in Russia, Aleksei Navalny. The app, going under the name Navalny, was removed from the Apple app store and the Google Play store just as voting got underway during the Russian Parliamentary Elections. Quoting from David Kaye, A former United Nations official’s statement from a New York Times article about this issue, ““They are de facto carrying out an element of Russian repression. Whether it’s justifiable or not, it’s complicity and the companies need to explain it.””(Troianovski, Satariano) This ban completely eliminated the ability to install the Navalny app on IOS. On Android however, “Sideloading”, or the ability to install apps outside of the official app store, is possible. Additionally, During the Hong Kong protests, Apple removed an app used by Hong Kong protestors to monitor police locations. According to the New York Times, “ Apple removed an app late Wednesday that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track the police...”(Nicas). Additionally, Zoom implemented new censorship features for people in China and Hong Kong.(Porter) Schools shouldn’t support companies that engage in this kind of malfeasance. These are just a couple examples, there are many more. To see more examples of mistreatment, visit https://gnu.org/proprietary.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px">The third and final reason for schools to use free software is that it can save schools money. This advantage may be the most appealing to school administrators, but it is trivial compared to the ethical issues at stake. Free software enables the school to save money because of the freedom provided. The programs are frequently distributed gratis, and even those that charge for a copy, the school is only required to purchase one copy, and they can share a copy with all of the students.</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px">The school will have some costs that aren’t associated with the software however, such as the cost of training teachers on how to use the new programs, as well as retraining their Technical Support staff on how to troubleshoot issues with these programs. Generally, these costs are still much lower than they are when a school uses mostly proprietary software. According to a study by Becta(British Educational Communications and Technology Agency). Implementing free software netted primary schools a 44% savings, and secondary schools a 34% savings. As one Technology administrator in the study put it, “If I moved anywhere else [...] I’d implement OSS because the financial savings are considerable and this releases more resources to tackle successful implementation.” This shows that the cost savings enabled the schools to dedicate their resources to improve the school.</p>
  <br />
   <p style="font-size: 18px">One may agree with the points laid out previously in this essay, but believe that it is impractical. Even though it seems good in theory, Very few schools have implemented it, so how could it be expected to work? However, A large state in an already large country has implemented exclusively free software. The state of Kerala, India has implemented exclusively free software in its schools. 37 million students attend schools in Kerala each day across its over 16,000 schools,  and they have made a commitment to free software,“In August 2008, Government had instructed all institutions under General Education Department to strictly use Free Software alone in all future teaching and training activities and a Government Order in this regard is in effect..” After using free software for over 8 years, they have become so confident in free software that they have completely banned the use of proprietary software. </p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-size: 18px"> So, If a company says that their software is free, consider the much more impactful denotation of the word, Freedom! If this essay was persuasive, there are many ways to help the cause. Campaigning for schools to migrate to free software is one way. Creating free software, supporting free software financially, or even just saying free software are other ways. The community can’t compete with large software companies directly, in a battle of resources. The only way is with hearts and minds.</p>
